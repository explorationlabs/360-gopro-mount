# 360 GoPro Mount

360° GoPro Mount for VR filming. 

The file gopro_360_external.ipt can be 3D printed to create a 360° GoPro mount. The file takes around 18 hours to print at high density on a Dimension 3D printer.

For full spherical 360° filming, the mount requires 6 GoPros in waterproof housings. The mount does not provide enough overlap between the cameras to film underwater, but the waterproof housings provide an easy mounting mechanism as well as protection from splashes, rain, etc.
